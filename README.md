# Profile Page Implementation
## Overview
This project is a dynamic profile page built using Vue 3 and Swarmauri's UI component library. The profile page includes features such as:
- A responsive carousel to display images.
- A profile section with an avatar and a form.
- Progress bars indicating profile completion.
- A footer with navigation links.

This project is a demo and demonstrates my ability to integrate third-party UI libraries, style components effectively, and troubleshoot challenges during implementation.
